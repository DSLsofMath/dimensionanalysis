** Converting 0Z, etc.
+ lhs2TeX parses 0Z as two tokens which makes the formatting bad.
+ Solution: rename them in the Agda file, then use %format directives.
+ Step 1: Collect all (visible) uses and rename them
  0Q -> q0
  1q -> q1
  0ℤ -> ℤ0
  1ℤ -> ℤ1
  2ℤ -> ℤ2
+ Step 2: Add format directives
%format q0 = 0 "_{" q "}"
%format q1 = 1 "_{" q "}"
%format ℤ0 = 0 "_{" ℤ "}"
%format ℤ1 = 1 "_{" ℤ "}"
%format ℤ2 = 2 "_{" ℤ "}"
